# Jayci Rae - AI Assistant

## Project Overview
Jayci Rae is a web-based AI assistant designed to interact with users through a chat interface. Created by Marty Montgomery, this application leverages various AI services to provide users with insights and answers to their inquiries. Jayci Rae features a friendly, intuitive interface and is capable of simulating conversations using pre-defined AI responses.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jayci-rae-ai-assistant
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser:**
   You can simply double-click the file or open it through a web server.

3. **No additional installations are necessary**, as the project uses external libraries through CDN links.

## Usage
Once the application is open in the browser, you can interact with Jayci Rae by typing your messages in the input field and clicking the "Send" button or pressing the Enter key. The assistant will respond with a simulated message from various AI services like ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.

### Note:
- The "Add More" button currently does not perform any actions, but it signifies potential future functionality for connecting additional AI services.

## Features
- User-friendly chat interface
- Integration with multiple AI services, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard
- Randomized, simulated AI responses for engaging conversations
- Responsiveness and dynamic styling using Tailwind CSS

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following external libraries:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons in the user interface.
- **Google Fonts**: Specifically the Poppins font family for a clean typography.

These libraries are linked directly in the `index.html` file via CDN, so no additional installations are needed.
